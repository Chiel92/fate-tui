SHORT TERM
Add window displaying the logs
Move prompt functionality from statuswin to commandwin
Allow statements and multiple lines in commandwin
Make sure fields also get completed in commandwindow
Improve navigating through display of text, actiontree and clipboard
Think about keymap
    Make keymap part of session,
    Make interaction keymap part of interaction
    Maybe a certain part of the key mapping has to be moved to fatecore
    We want dvorak user to be able to easily transform
    We want the key capture to be left to the user interface
    We may not want an intermediate key representation because it makes customizing more difficult because the intermediate keymap may differ from the keys the user uses.

LONG TERM
Unicode art and colors!
Easier file opening
