SHORT TERM
rewrite statuswin.prompt not to use textpad
Patch unicurses pdcurses detection
Make getchar robust and work with unicode
fix logging system

fix drawing bug with multiple intervals
fix some bugs with multiple sessions
allow easy hide/show/placement of windows
    don't restrict this in any way
line numbers
Move prompt functionality from statuswin to commandwin
Improve navigating through display of text, actiontree and clipboard
Think about keymap
    Make keymap part of session,
    Make interaction keymap part of interaction
    Maybe a certain part of the key mapping has to be moved to fatecore
    We want dvorak user to be able to easily transform
    We want the key capture to be left to the user interface
    An intermediate key representation may be suitable as long as it is general enough to be able to represent any key on any platform. That way, customizing keymap is done in fate itself, which makes it portable. That is good.


LONG TERM
Unicode art and colors!
Easier file opening
