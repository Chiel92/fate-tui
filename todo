SHORT TERM
make ui member of session, then scope split is not needed anymore
    i.e. ui_actions can receive a session
first check for colors before colorpair init
line numbers
check if uiactions keymap can be merged
Add window displaying the logs
Move prompt functionality from statuswin to commandwin
Allow statements and multiple lines in commandwin
Make sure fields also get completed in commandwindow
Improve navigating through display of text, actiontree and clipboard
Think about keymap
    Make keymap part of session,
    Make interaction keymap part of interaction
    Maybe a certain part of the key mapping has to be moved to fatecore
    We want dvorak user to be able to easily transform
    We want the key capture to be left to the user interface
    An intermediate key representation may be suitable as long as it is general enough to be able to represent any key on any platform. That way, customizing keymap is done in fate itself, which makes it portable. That is good.


LONG TERM
Unicode art and colors!
Easier file opening
